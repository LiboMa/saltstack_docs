# SETTING UP PILLAR
The pillar is already running in Salt by default. To see the minion's pillar data:

salt '*' pillar.items

#To ensure that the minions have the new pillar data, issue a command to them asking that they fetch their pillars from the master:

salt '*' saltutil.refresh_pillar

using pillar in Jinji files

# example.template

folder="{{ pillar['app_weblog'] }}"

# pillar.template.sls
app_weblog=/opt/testapp
